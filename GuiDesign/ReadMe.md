# GuiDesign ReadMe
This IntelliJ project is for convenient designing and testing of Smalltalk GUIs
before coding them in Smalltalk.
So the executable created here is a dummy and not needed to run SmallJ.
If you change a GUI in Smalltalk, please also update its design here.

Note:
This project should only use components that are standard in the Java framework.
So not IntelliJ specific components like GridLayoutManager.
